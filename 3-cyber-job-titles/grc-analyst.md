## 👋 About Me  

Analytical and detail-oriented **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Analyst** passionate about building secure, compliant, and resilient organizations.  
I specialize in aligning security controls with business objectives, assessing risks, and ensuring adherence to regulatory frameworks such as **NIST, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR**.  

My approach to GRC blends both strategy and execution — from conducting risk assessments and internal audits to creating policies and driving awareness across teams. I enjoy simplifying complex security requirements into actionable processes that protect business operations while enabling innovation.  

Currently focused on advancing my knowledge in **cloud compliance**, **vendor risk management**, and **third-party assurance frameworks**. My long-term goal is to become a **Security Risk & Compliance Manager**, guiding organizations through maturity in governance and assurance practices.
