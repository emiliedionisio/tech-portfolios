## 👋 About Me  

Curious and analytical **Junior Malware Analyst** passionate about understanding how malicious software works — and how to stop it.  
I specialize in **reverse engineering**, **sandbox testing**, and **threat intelligence**, using my technical curiosity to uncover the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) behind real-world malware attacks.  

I enjoy deconstructing malware samples in a controlled lab environment, identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs), and writing reports that help improve detection and response strategies. My focus is on bridging technical analysis with actionable insights that strengthen security operations and threat detection.  

Currently advancing my expertise in **static and dynamic malware analysis**, **YARA rule creation**, and **malware classification using MITRE ATT&CK mapping**. My long-term goal is to become a **Threat Intelligence Researcher**, contributing to global efforts in identifying and mitigating emerging cyber threats.
