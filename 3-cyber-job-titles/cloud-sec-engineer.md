## 👋 About Me  

Passionate **Cloud Security Engineer** with hands-on experience in securing AWS and Azure cloud environments, automating compliance checks, and designing scalable, resilient, and secure architectures.  

I thrive at the intersection of **cloud infrastructure, automation, and cybersecurity**, helping organizations build secure systems without compromising agility. My expertise includes **IAM governance**, **network segmentation**, **threat detection**, and **incident response** in cloud-native environments.  

I enjoy implementing **DevSecOps practices** — integrating security into CI/CD pipelines and leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to standardize and scale security posture across multi-account environments.  

Currently focused on advancing my skills in **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**, **Zero Trust Architecture**, and **Security Automation** using Python and Terraform.
